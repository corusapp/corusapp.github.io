  headline: Our Solution
  content: <p>Once the user registers on the application and enables the Bluetooth, the app scans for nearby Bluetooth devices and keeps a log of their Bluetooth Signature in the user's mobile device. The app keeps a log of the last 21 days. In the meantime, if a user goes for a COVID-19 test and the results are positive. They have an option to mark themselves as positive on the app. Once, the user marks itself positive, the regulatory body using the application will verify whether that person is providing the correct information. <strong>After the information is verified</strong>, push notifications are sent to all the Bluetooth Signature's who were in the close proximity of the user (i.e. within 2 meters). The simple and minimalistic interface also ensures ease of access and usage for all age brackets of users.</p><br /><p>We take advantage of the fact that all the COVID-19 tests are recorded in the world and the verification is easier. Verification is a must as the spread of misinformation is as harmful as the diseases.</p><br /><p>Once we have enough users who have marked themselves positive, we will highlight the positive zones on the map so that people can take precautions accordingly.</p>

  headline: Challenges
  content: <p>One of the major issues that come with the creation of a tracking application is the concern of privacy and data usage. It is our goal to ensure the privacy of the data, and we shouldn’t be a ‘Big Brother’ which tracks everything.</p><br /><p>It is of foremost importance that the users are assured that the app isn't spying on them. It is for this reason that CorUS has no GPS tracking. </p><br /><p>Although the application needs a lot of data processing and correlation, it is mostly serverless. </p><br /><p>Another challenge we’re running to is reaching out to the governmental entities to adopt the application, but our team will surely persevere and make sure that it gets done.</p>
